   A creeper is a common hostile mob that silently approaches players and then explodes, which can destroy blocks and kill unarmored players on any difficulty (except for peaceful).
When struck by lightning, the creeper becomes a charged creeper, which amplifies its explosion power and enables mob heads to be obtained from piglins, zombies, skeletons, and other creepers it kills.

Due to its distinctive appearance and unique, destructive method of attack, the creeper has become one of the most iconic mobs in Minecraft, being featured in promotional materials and merchandise.
